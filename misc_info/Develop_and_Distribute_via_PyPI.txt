Create a proper setup.py file in the root directory. 

Source files should go into a package under the root.

Additional files and directories can go directly beneath the root. Especially if they are going to be needed during execution. 

Even though the source is under the site-packages directory, the root is considered the curdir at runtime. 

PyPi doesn't require any registration/testing, you deploy straight to public distribution. 

The best workflow I found so far is to build locally and then install using the pip install -e . command.  This will install the latest wheel build from the dist directory. 

1. edit code and docs as required.
2. commit and tag with current version.
3. wheel build: python setup.py bdist_wheel
4. source build: python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar
5. clean out any old files from the dist folder
6. then, to install locally and do development/testing: pip install -e .
7. upload to pypi: twine upload dist/*                                                                                                
8. Follow the online install instructions and prove you can install the package with pip as a regular user.
