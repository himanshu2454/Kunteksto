Kunteksto does not *currently* include Python code testing.

However, there is a test CSV file (test_gen.csv) in the example_Data directory.

This CSV file is the basis for the kunteksto_test.db. The database contains a  **Demo** model and completed set of components as well as a **TestDB** model and completed components. By generating, exporting and validating the models and instances using external tools such as Xerces or Saxon you can verify the validity of Kunteksto models and data instances.
