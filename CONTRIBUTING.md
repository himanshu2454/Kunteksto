Contributing to Kunteksto
=========================

As an open source project, Kunteksto welcomes contributions of many forms.

Examples of contributions include:

* Code patches
* Documentation improvements
* Bug reports and patch reviews

**Warning:** non-trivial pull requests (anything more than fixing a typo) without a filed Issue will be ignored.
Please file an Issue for significant problems.

Kunteksto uses project Issues to keep track of bugs, feature requests, and associated
patches.
Patches can be submitted as pull requests, but if you don't file a ticket,
it's unlikely that we'll notice your contribution.
