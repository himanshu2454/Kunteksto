# Kunteksto

The Context tool for your data.

Based on S3M technology - "Esperanto for Data". 

Kunteksto allows you to build shareable models that adds context to otherwise brain-dead CSV data. 

The data science world will  be amazed at how awesome your data and the analysis results can be.

What is 'Context' for your data?

It is the combination of ontological, temporal and spatial semantics that describes the deeper meaning of your data allowing you to share 'information' instead of just 'data'.
